The experience of adapting to a new city and making new friends taught him valuable lessons about companionship and friendship.

For his higher secondary education, Aayush returned to Vadodara in Grade 11, this time enrolling at Podar World School, Sherkhi. He completed his Grade 12 from this institution, before moving to Rajasthan for his undergraduate studies.

Currently, Aayush is pursuing his B.Tech in Computer Software Engineering with a specialization in AI/ML at NIIT University in Neemrana, Rajasthan. He chose this path because of his long-standing passion for computer science and his fascination with artificial intelligence.

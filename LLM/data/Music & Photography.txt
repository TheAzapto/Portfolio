Music & Photography

Aayush Dutta's creative pursuits extend beyond digital arts into the realms of music and photography, both of which he has cultivated as meaningful hobbies that enrich his life and provide outlets for artistic expression.

Piano Journey

Aayush's relationship with piano began in Grade 4 during music class, where he first took up the instrument as part of his school curriculum. He learned under the guidance of his school's music teacher, receiving his foundational training in piano playing during these early years.

When Aayush shifted schools and moved to Pune in Grade 7, he continued his musical education by joining piano classes. This is where his training became more structured and formal. During this period, he learned music theory and how to read sheet music, which gave him a deeper understanding of music beyond just playing by ear.

However, like many of his skills, much of Aayush's piano journey has been self-taught. After his formal lessons, he continued to develop his skills independently by looking up ways to play songs he loved and building upon existing ideas. This self-directed learning approach has allowed him to develop his own style and explore music that resonates with him personally.

Musical Repertoire

Aayush has learned to play a diverse range of pieces that span from classical to contemporary, from film scores to popular music:

Classical Pieces:
- Für Elise (Beethoven) - One of the most famous piano pieces, which Aayush has mastered

Contemporary and Film Music:
- "My Heart Will Go On" (from Titanic) - The iconic Céline Dion song
- "Interstellar" (Hans Zimmer) - The emotionally powerful theme from Christopher Nolan's film
- E Rush

Pop Music:
- A very difficult variation of "Attention" (Charlie Puth) - Aayush specifically notes this as a challenging piece he successfully learned, demonstrating his technical proficiency

This eclectic mix of repertoire shows Aayush's versatility as a pianist and his willingness to tackle challenging pieces. His choice of music reflects his personality—drawn to emotionally resonant pieces that tell stories, whether through classical elegance, cinematic grandeur, or contemporary pop.

Musical Skills and Approach

Aayush's piano playing combines several approaches:

Formal Training:
His early lessons gave him proper technique, posture, and foundational skills. Learning music theory and sheet music reading has allowed him to understand the structure of music and interpret written compositions.

Self-Directed Learning:
Much of his development has come from independently learning pieces he's passionate about. This approach has taught him how to break down complex pieces, identify patterns, and develop his own practice methods.

Building on Existing Ideas:
Aayush mentions that he looks up ways to play songs and builds upon existing ideas. This suggests he's comfortable with adaptation and interpretation, taking existing arrangements and making them his own or combining different approaches to arrive at his interpretation.

Skill Level

Aayush describes himself as "good enough" at piano, which in context of the challenging pieces he has learned (particularly the difficult variation of "Attention"), suggests a high intermediate to advanced skill level. His ability to play complex arrangements and emotionally nuanced pieces like the Interstellar theme demonstrates significant technical proficiency and musical sensitivity.

Photography

In addition to music, Aayush pursues photography as a hobby, with a particular focus on natural beauty and scenic photography. His approach to photography is characterized by a preference for authenticity and natural aesthetics.

Photography Style:
Aayush is drawn to capturing natural beauty and scenic landscapes. He appreciates the raw beauty of nature and scenic views without artificial enhancement. His preference is for aesthetic photos that don't rely on filters—he loves capturing images that are beautiful in their natural state.

This philosophy aligns with his general approach to creative work: appreciating genuine quality and letting the subject speak for itself rather than over-processing or artificially enhancing.

Approach:
Photography for Aayush is a casual hobby rather than a professional pursuit. It's something he does for personal enjoyment, to capture moments and scenes that resonate with him. His photography serves as another creative outlet and a way to document his experiences and observations of the natural world.

While he doesn't engage in photography professionally or for projects, his eye for composition developed through his graphic design work likely informs his photographic choices, helping him frame and capture compelling images.

Creative Balance

Both piano and photography serve as important creative outlets for Aayush, providing balance to his technical work in programming and AI/ML. Music offers him a way to express emotion and engage with art in a tactile, performative way, while photography allows him to observe and capture beauty in the world around him.

These pursuits also reflect Aayush's broader approach to life: a desire to explore different forms of expression, continuous self-improvement (teaching himself challenging piano pieces), and appreciation for authenticity (preferring unfiltered photography). They add depth to his personality and demonstrate that his interests extend well beyond the purely technical realm.
